# Gmail Get All Email Addressees from Inbox or Sent Between Dates Using Query
### Using the Gmail api get all email addressees from inbox, sent, or any other label using a query.
Often time you may want filter all emails between dates or by some query parameters like in:sent. However, if you simply wanted to know all people who you sent or received emails from and get a list of their email addresses, it was not very easy as you would have had to manually copy inspect and copy each email (in my case I had 1795 emails to go through). 
If you find you need to do this often, consider converting to a normal script file.
